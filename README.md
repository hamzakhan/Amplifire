Max - Needs to do better about taking standup notes
- Security model is confusing for P0
- Started security badge

Andrew Garmon - 

Jacob - Ask about Jared's example and if we are required to have fields for objects. Earlier we were told a ERD has just objects and relationships.

Andrew Clark - Trying to redo ERD to make it cleaner and more functional.

Matthew - 

General Group
-Slight confusion as to what a profile is a does. Are they unique?
- Us being behind doesn't seem to be our fault yet we suffer for it. Poor prepation in pacing for class. 
- We understand that there are an absurd amount of questions but this should somewhat be accounted for. The mutual understanding is the platform connection and confusion.
