General Group
- light confusion as to what a profile is a does. Are they unique?
- Us being behind doesn't seem to be our fault yet we suffer for it. Poor prepation in pacing for class. 
- We understand that there are an absurd amount of questions but this should somewhat be accounted for. The mutual understanding is the platform connection and confusion.
